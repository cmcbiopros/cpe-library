# New Features - CPE Library Update

This document describes the new features added to address the issues with like persistence and broken webinar links.

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

1. **Like Button Persistence**: The like button now saves counts across users/sessions
2. **Broken Link Cleanup**: System to detect and remove courses that return 404 errors

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Persistent Like Counts

**Problem**: Like counts were only stored in browser localStorage, so they didn't persist across different users or sessions.

**Solution**: 
- Likes are now saved to the `webinars.json` file
- Each webinar can have a `likes` field that persists across all users
- User-specific like status is still tracked in localStorage
- When a user likes/unlikes a webinar, the global count is updated and saved to the server

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `script.js` - Updated `toggleLike()` method to save to server
- `save_likes.php` - New PHP script to handle like persistence
- `webinars.json` - Now includes `likes` field for each webinar

### 2. Broken Link Detection and Cleanup

**Problem**: Some webinar URLs return 404 errors, making them inaccessible to users.

**Solution**:
- Created URL validation system to check all webinar URLs
- Automated cleanup script to remove broken links
- Admin panel integration for easy cleanup management

**Files Added**:
- `validate_urls.py` - Comprehensive URL validation with threading
- `cleanup_broken_links.py` - Simple cleanup script for broken links
- `run_cleanup_broken_links.py` - Easy-to-use runner script
- `run_cleanup_broken_links.php` - PHP wrapper for admin panel integration

### 3. Admin Panel Integration

**New Features**:
- "Cleanup Broken Links" button in admin panel
- Progress indicator during cleanup process
- Automatic data refresh after cleanup
- Backup creation before making changes

## 🚀 How to Use

### Like Persistence
- **Automatic**: Likes are automatically saved when users click the like button
- **No Action Required**: The system works transparently in the background

### Broken Link Cleanup

#### Option 1: Admin Panel (Recommended)
1. Open the admin panel
2. Click "Cleanup Broken Links" button
3. Confirm the action when prompted
4. Wait for the process to complete
5. Review the results

#### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Dry run (see what would be removed)
python3 cleanup_broken_links.py --dry-run

# Actual cleanup with backup
python3 cleanup_broken_links.py --backup

# Or use the runner script
python3 run_cleanup_broken_links.py
```

#### Option 3: Advanced Validation
```bash
# Use the comprehensive validator with threading
python3 validate_urls.py --dry-run --max-workers 10
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Like Persistence Architecture
```
User clicks like → Update local count → Save to webinars.json → Notify other users
```

### URL Validation Process
```
Load webinars.json → Check each URL → Categorize results → Remove broken links → Save updated data
```

### Safety Features
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backups before any changes
- **Dry Run Mode**: Test what would be removed without making changes
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: User confirmation before destructive operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and timeouts

## 📊 Monitoring

### Like Counts
- Check `webinars.json` for the `likes` field on each webinar
- Monitor user engagement through like statistics

### Link Health
- Run cleanup scripts regularly to maintain link health
- Monitor the admin panel for broken link reports
- Check backup files to track what was removed

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Run broken link cleanup
2. **Monthly**: Review like statistics and popular webinars
3. **Quarterly**: Check backup files and clean up old ones

### Troubleshooting
- If likes aren't persisting: Check PHP permissions and `save_likes.php`
- If cleanup fails: Check Python dependencies and network connectivity
- If admin panel doesn't work: Verify PHP scripts are accessible

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- PHP scripts include proper headers and error handling
- Backup files are created before any destructive operations
- User input is validated before processing
- No sensitive data is exposed in error messages

## 📈 Performance

- URL validation uses threading for faster processing
- Like persistence is asynchronous and doesn't block the UI
- Cleanup operations can be run during low-traffic periods
- Backup files are automatically cleaned up (keeps last 5)

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Like counts now provide real value to users
2. **Data Quality**: Broken links are automatically detected and removed
3. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Automated cleanup reduces manual work
4. **Data Integrity**: Backup system protects against data loss
5. **Scalability**: System can handle large numbers of webinars efficiently
